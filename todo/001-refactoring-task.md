# Refactoring Task: Split Monolithic HTML

## Goal
Transform the 3,378-line index.html into a well-structured, modular codebase while maintaining all functionality and GitHub Pages compatibility.

## Approach
Each step will be non-breaking, tested, and committed separately before proceeding.

### Why Each Step is Non-Breaking:
- **Steps 1-5 (CSS Extraction)**: We're copying CSS to external files and adding `<link>` tags. The original functionality remains unchanged.
- **Steps 6-9 (JS Extraction)**: We're copying JavaScript to external files and adding `<script>` tags. All code execution order is preserved.
- **Step 10 (Cleanup)**: We only remove the code that's already been successfully externalized.
- **Steps 11-13 (Enhancements)**: These are additive changes that don't affect existing functionality.

- Foundation prepared for Phase 3 development

**Next Epic**: Complete Inventory Overview Screen Implementation

## Testing Checklist (After Each Step)
- [ ] All screens display correctly
- [ ] Navigation works between screens
- [ ] Demo controls function properly
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile/tablet
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Page loads without flash of unstyled content

## Notes
- Each step is designed to be atomic and non-breaking
- User should test after each commit
- If any step breaks functionality, we can easily revert
- Priority on maintaining GitHub Pages compatibility (no build process)
