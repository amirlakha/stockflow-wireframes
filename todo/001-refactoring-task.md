# Refactoring Task: Split Monolithic HTML

## Goal
Transform the 3,378-line index.html into a well-structured, modular codebase while maintaining all functionality and GitHub Pages compatibility.

## Approach
Each step will be non-breaking, tested, and committed separately before proceeding.

### Why Each Step is Non-Breaking:
- **Steps 1-5 (CSS Extraction)**: We're copying CSS to external files and adding `<link>` tags. The original functionality remains unchanged.
- **Steps 6-9 (JS Extraction)**: We're copying JavaScript to external files and adding `<script>` tags. All code execution order is preserved.
- **Step 10 (Cleanup)**: We only remove the code that's already been successfully externalized.
- **Steps 11-13 (Enhancements)**: These are additive changes that don't affect existing functionality.
